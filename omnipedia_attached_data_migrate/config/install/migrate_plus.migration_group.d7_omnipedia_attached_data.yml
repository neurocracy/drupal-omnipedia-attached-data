    # This is the database connection to use for this migration group. Make sure
    # this is defined in settings.php or a file included by settings.php. You'll
    # get an error if this database connection isn't defined. Also note that
    # 'key' refers to the top-level database, while 'target' refers to the
    # second level, the latter of which you don't need to specify unless you
    # have multiple replica databases. We want to use 'key'. In summary:
